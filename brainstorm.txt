> Build re-usable components that can be easily implemented
Required components:
    > Navbar
        >> what is a navigation icon?
            > Pretty sure it's just one of those icons from that open-src
            icon website he showed me
    > Button
        >> Also needs to be able to take in a button 
    > Floating Action Button
        >> Need to look up how to do a box-shadow
    > Image Carousel
        >> This is going to be tricky
    > Loading Spinners X 3
        >> Not sure what animated text would be, just something
        that says 'loading...' with the three dots appearing one
        at a time and then disappearing?
        >> How would a loading spinner be interactive? The only
        thing I can think of is like a little thing that jumps
        when you click it or changes color or something

> Documentation for how the components work and how to implement them
    (A simple website that does serves this purpose)
For each one:
    > The component itself
    > Any HTML, CSS, or JS that has been used for the component
        >> Use the HTML pre tag to display your code
            >> Have to use escape characters to write code in <pre> in 
            html, but if you write it in js surrounded by `` you don't
            have to 
    ** Any code should be able to be copy-pasted and easily used
    by anybody

notes:
> Organize each component into its own html, css, and js files to make it
easier to prepare the documentation at the end
